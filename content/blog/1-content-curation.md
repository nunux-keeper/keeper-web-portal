It makes sense to start this product blog with a quick introduction of the
concept behind this product. **Nunux Keeper** is introduced as a *free content
curation system*. But what that means?

## Definition

![Curator in a museum][curator]

In a museum a [curator][wikipedia] (or a keeper) is the manager in charge of
selecting the artworks and value their exhibits. Wikipedia provides us a far
better [definition][wikipedia].

> In short it's the action to **select**, **edit** and **share** content.

In the wonder world of Internet, this work is called **content curation**.
It is no more related to art works but web content.

Internet produces billions of documents more or less relevant, more or less
readable, more or less messed up with ads. Therefore, when you practice
information watch, it can be difficult to read everything or organise yourself
with all those informations.
Content curation is a response to that problem. Manage your information watch.
And Nunux Keeper is a tool to help you in that quest.

## Nunux Keeper

I started [this project][keeper] in 2014 just after another project called
[Nunux Reader][reader]. A RSS feed aggregator born (like many other) just after
the end of Google Reader.
RSS takes a really big part into my daily technology watch. Still today. But, I
quickly got to need to archive, organize, classify, retrieve and share the
selected contents of this watch. At this time Pocket was launched and seemed to
be perfect. And it was. But like many online products there are some drawbacks.
Pocket don't allow you to export your curation job. Pocket API is limited to
retrieve only first lines of the document. It is obviously to protect Pocket.
It's seem to be fair for a cheap and powerful online service like Pocket but
your are not free to dispose your data as you could expect. As usual you are
the product and your data are precious not only for you but moreover for
marketing. Most people don't care about this kind of limitation, but not me.
So I start this new project.

> Yet another open source tool to do poorly the job that other product do
> with perfection  \o/

Since 2014 Nunux Keeper have quietly evolve. And today comes the version 2.

Into the following articles I will try to present the product, explain
technology choices, explains internals, and share ideas of improvement.
I love to share my technology watch but I think it's also time to share my nerdy
work.
